Hello everyone! Wow, what a week we’ve had at Retrium! We’ve been interviewing a lot of amazing developers this week for a couple new senior developer positions that are open. It’s been a great experience for Ryan and myself to get to talk in-depth with so many talented people. The hardest part will definitely be deciding who to bring on to the team.

In other news, we’ve been hard at work this week refactoring the phases over to a more traditional Redux architecture. We’re finally wrapping up getting the Group phase put back together and functioning normally (along with a very cool new feature!). So far, we’ve seen none of the performance problems that we were having in the group phase before - fingers crossed!

We've also been working on some functionality for a very commonly asked-for feature this week! *cough* *collaborative grouping* - Did somebody say something? Huh, must have been the wind. Seriously though, the feature is still a ways off, but we're making some real headway in that direction. We'll keep you posted as we progress with that feature.

We’re really pushing ourselves hard to get the much needed performance improvements wrapped up by the end of the month, or at the very least early next year.  Thanks for reading and have a great weekend!
