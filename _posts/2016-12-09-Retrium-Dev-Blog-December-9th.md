Hello everyone! Over the past few months, our customers have been asking us about various feature releases and where we are in regards to those. The dev team over here at Retrium decided that starting a dev blog would be a fun way to keep everyone posted about what we’ve been working on.

The past few weeks at Retrium have been pretty hectic after we discovered a huge performance issue affecting our Internet Explorer users. Since then, we’ve been hard at work refactoring our code to use Redux and have seen some amazing performance increases across the entire application. We’re hoping to get all of that wrapped up here in the next couple weeks, so stay tuned!

In other news, we’ve also added a patch that should help out some of our customers that have firewall restrictions that block outgoing web socket connections. Our web socket connection now falls back to browserchannel, which is much like web sockets but with HTTP.

We’re going to do our best to keep these posts coming once a week, so stay tuned to keep up with what the devs here at Retrium are up to. Have a great week everyone!
